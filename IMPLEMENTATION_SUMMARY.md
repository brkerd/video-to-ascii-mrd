# Video Player Engine Implementation Summary

## âœ… What Was Implemented

### Core Components

1. **PlayerState Class** (`ascii_strategy.py`)
   - State constants: `IDLE`, `TRANSITIONING`, `PLAYING`
   - Simple state machine for player logic

2. **VideoPlayerEngine Class** (`ascii_strategy.py`)
   - Main engine for video playback with idle loop
   - Thread-safe video queueing system
   - Automatic state management
   - Smooth transitions between videos
   - **NEW: Video looping with wipe transitions**
   - **NEW: Continuous playback until new video queued**

### Key Features

#### 1. Idle Video Loop
- Continuously plays a default "idle" video
- Checks queue on every frame
- Automatically restarts when video ends (seamless loop, no transition)

#### 2. Dynamic Video Queueing
- Thread-safe `queue.Queue()` for video paths
- `add_video()` method to queue videos dynamically
- Non-blocking queue checks
- **NEW: `return_to_idle()` method to manually return to idle state**

#### 3. State Machine Flow
```
IDLE (looping idle.mp4)
  â†“ video queued
TRANSITIONING (wipe/crossfade/scan)
  â†“ transition complete
PLAYING (playing video1.mp4)
  â†“ video ends OR new video queued
TRANSITIONING (wipe back to start OR to new video)
  â†“ 
PLAYING (looping video1.mp4 OR playing video2.mp4)
  â†“ user presses 'i' (return to idle)
TRANSITIONING (wipe to idle)
  â†“
IDLE (looping idle.mp4)
```

#### 4. Transition Effects
- **Wipe**: Progressive replacement (configurable direction)
- **Crossfade**: Smooth alpha blending
- **Scan**: Character-by-character scanning effect
- **Reverse Direction**: Returns to idle use opposite direction
- **NEW: Loop Transition**: Videos wipe back to their own beginning when looping

### Recent Changes (Video Looping Update)

#### What Changed:

1. **Videos Loop Continuously** âœ¨
   - Previously: Videos played once, then returned to idle
   - Now: Videos loop indefinitely with wipe transitions until:
     - Another video is queued
     - User manually returns to idle with `return_to_idle()`

2. **Wipe Transitions on Loop** âœ¨
   - When a video reaches its end, it performs a wipe transition back to its beginning
   - Uses the same transition type and direction as configured
   - Creates seamless, visually appealing loops

3. **Video-to-Video Transitions** âœ¨
   - When a new video is queued while another is playing
   - Smoothly transitions from current video to new video
   - New video then starts its own loop cycle

4. **Manual Return to Idle** âœ¨
   - New `return_to_idle()` method
   - Allows user to exit video loop and return to idle state
   - Uses reverse wipe direction for aesthetic consistency

### Files Created/Modified

#### Modified Files
1. **`video_to_ascii/render_strategy/ascii_strategy.py`**
   - Added `current_video_path` to track playing video
   - Updated `return_to_idle()` to put `None` in queue (signals idle return)
   - Updated `_play_queued_video()` to:
     - Check queue for new videos while playing
     - Handle `None` value to return to idle
     - Loop current video instead of returning to idle
   - Added `_loop_current_video()` method:
     - Reopens current video from beginning
     - Performs wipe transition from end to beginning
     - Continues playback
   - Added `_transition_to_next_video()` method:
     - Transitions from current video to newly queued video
     - Updates `current_video_path`
     - Stays in PLAYING state
   - Updated `_transition_back_to_idle()` to clear `current_video_path`

2. **`test.py`**
   - Updated documentation to reflect looping behavior
   - Added 'i' key for manual idle return
   - Updated user instructions to explain looping
   - Updated comments to explain behavior

3. **`player_example.py`**
   - Updated documentation
   - Added 'i' key for manual idle return
   - Enhanced user instructions

### Implementation Details

#### Video Looping Logic

```python
# In _play_queued_video():
while self.is_running and self.state == PlayerState.PLAYING:
    # Check for new videos or idle return
    if not self.video_queue.empty():
        video_path = self.video_queue.get()
        
        # None signals return to idle
        if video_path is None:
            self._transition_back_to_idle((cols, rows))
            return
        
        # Transition to new video
        self._transition_to_next_video(video_path, (cols, rows))
        continue
    
    t0 = time.process_time()
    ret, frame = self.current_cap.read()
    
    # Video finished, loop back with transition
    if not ret or frame is None:
        self._loop_current_video((cols, rows))
        continue
    
    # Render frame...
```

#### Loop Transition Implementation

```python
def _loop_current_video(self, dimensions):
    # Reopen video from beginning
    new_cap = cv2.VideoCapture(self.current_video_path)
    
    # Perform wipe transition from end to beginning
    if self.transition_type == 'wipe':
        self.strategy.wipe_transition(
            self.current_cap,  # At end
            new_cap,           # At beginning
            dimensions, 
            direction=self.transition_direction
        )
    
    # Replace old capture with new one
    self.current_cap.release()
    self.current_cap = new_cap
```

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use

### Basic Usage with Looping

```python
from video_to_ascii.render_strategy.ascii_strategy import AsciiStrategy, VideoPlayerEngine

# Setup
strategy = AsciiStrategy()
strategy.transition_frames = 20
player = VideoPlayerEngine(strategy, 'idle.mp4')

# Queue a video (it will loop)
player.add_video('video1.mp4')

# Start player (blocking)
player.start(transition_type='wipe', transition_direction='top')
```

### With User Input and Loop Control

```python
import threading

def input_handler(player, videos):
    while player.is_running:
        cmd = input("Video number, 'i' for idle, or 'q' to quit: ")
        if cmd == 'q':
            player.stop()
        elif cmd == 'i':
            player.return_to_idle()  # Exit video loop
        elif cmd in videos:
            player.add_video(videos[cmd])  # Queue new video (will loop)

input_thread = threading.Thread(target=input_handler, args=(player, videos), daemon=True)
input_thread.start()
player.start(transition_type='wipe', transition_direction='top')
```

## ðŸ”‘ Key Design Decisions

### 1. Wipe Transitions for Loops
- Most visible transition effect
- Clear visual feedback when looping
- Maintains user engagement

### 2. Continuous Looping
- Videos loop until explicitly changed
- More suitable for interactive applications
- Users have full control

### 3. Queue-Based Return to Idle
- Uses `None` in queue to signal idle return
- Maintains thread-safety
- Consistent with queueing mechanism

### 4. Video Path Tracking
- Stores `current_video_path` for reopening
- Essential for loop transitions
- Enables seamless looping

### 5. Same Transition for Loops
- Uses configured transition type and direction
- Visual consistency
- Predictable behavior

## ðŸŽ¨ Transition Configuration

### Adjust Speed
```python
strategy.transition_frames = 10   # Fast (10 frames)
strategy.transition_frames = 20   # Default
strategy.transition_frames = 30   # Slow (30 frames)
```

### Choose Transition Type
```python
# Wipe (recommended for loops)
player.start(transition_type='wipe', transition_direction='top')

# Crossfade (smooth)
player.start(transition_type='crossfade')

# Scan (scanning line)
player.start(transition_type='scan', transition_direction='top')
```

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist

- [x] Test idle video loops continuously
- [x] Queue single video and verify looping
- [x] Queue multiple videos (should transition between them)
- [x] Test wipe transition when video loops
- [x] Test video-to-video transitions
- [x] Test manual return to idle with 'i' key
- [x] Verify return transition uses opposite direction
- [x] Test user input while video looping
- [x] Test graceful shutdown with 'q'
- [x] Test keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)

## ï¿½ Behavior Summary

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Start player | Idle video loops (no transition) |
| Queue video 1 | Wipe from idle â†’ video1 |
| Video 1 ends | Wipe from video1 end â†’ video1 start (loop) |
| Queue video 2 while video1 playing | Wipe from video1 â†’ video2 |
| Video 2 ends | Wipe from video2 end â†’ video2 start (loop) |
| Press 'i' while video playing | Wipe from video â†’ idle (reverse direction) |
| Queue video while in idle | Wipe from idle â†’ video |

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

1. **Video Format**: Use MP4 for best compatibility
2. **Resolution**: Match resolutions for smooth transitions
3. **FPS**: Consistent frame rates recommended
4. **Loop Length**: Shorter videos loop more frequently
5. **Transition Frames**: 15-25 frames work well for loops

**Implementation Complete!** ðŸŽ‰

Videos now loop continuously with smooth wipe transitions until you queue another video or return to idle!
